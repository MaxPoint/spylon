Generally this necessitates throwing away whole repositories of Python\r\ncode and starting over or resorting to service architectures (e.g., Apache\r\nthrift) which increase system complexity.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to.\r\n\r\nUsing py4j and Spylon you can readily interact with Scala code for more\r\nperformance critical sections of your whilst leaving the rest unmodified.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can use it as a bridge to allow building wrappers for a\r\nScala/Java codebase.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nSpylon can be installed either from pip or conda-forge\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nThe simplest way to use spylon is to use it to help with writing PySpark jobs.\r\nIf you want to supply your own jars to load for usage as Spark user defined\r\nfunctions, you'd want to supply the jar with the udf implementation to spark via\r\nspark-submit.\r\n\r\nFor an easier interactive experience you can make use of the supplied Apache\r\nSpark launcher to make it simpler to instantiate a PySpark application from\r\ninside a python Jupyter notebook.\r\n\r\nExtensions\r\n----------\r\nSpylon is designed as an easy to extend toolkit.  Since Apache Spark is a major\r\nuser or Py4J, some special use cases have been implemented for that and its an\r\nexample of some use cases for Spylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n.. |Version_Status| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/spylon.svg\r\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spylon/\r\n.. |Downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/spylon.svg\r\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spylon/\r\n.. |Conda_Forge| image:: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/spylon/badges/version.svg\r\n   :target: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/spylon\r\n.. |Travis| image:: https://travis-ci.org/MaxPoint/spylon.svg\r\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/MaxPoint/spylon\r\n",
